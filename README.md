# weather-app

Designed and developed a sleek and responsive weather information card using HTML and CSS. The card features an 
intuitive search bar, displaying real-time weather data for a user-entered city. The layout is clean and visually 
appealing, with a gradient background and carefully chosen color palette. CSS Flexbox was used for layout structuring, 
ensuring a consistent and polished appearance across different devices. The design showcases my proficiency in frontend web development, including form design, image integration, and responsive design principles."
